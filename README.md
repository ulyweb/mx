>> to configure firewall rules for Samba, is a known issue, particularly with the Plasma firewall interface (plasma-firewall) interacting with the underlying firewall backend (often UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall).

This might be happening and what you can do:

**Why it's happening:**

  * **Plasma Firewall Bug:** This error has been reported by many users across various KDE Plasma distributions, including MX Linux. It often occurs when trying to modify rules, especially with advanced settings, or when the GUI loses synchronization with the actual firewall service running in the background. It seems to be an intermittent issue with the plasma-firewall GUI itself.
  * **Backend Discrepancy:** While Plasma Firewall provides a graphical interface, it relies on a command-line firewall tool like UFW or Firewalld. If there's a mismatch in the state between the GUI and the backend, or if the backend service crashes or becomes unresponsive, you'll see this error.
  * **Permissions/Configuration:** Less likely, but incorrect permissions or a corrupted configuration file for either Plasma Firewall or UFW could lead to instability.

**How to allow Samba and fix the issue:**

The most reliable way to add firewall rules in MX Linux, especially for services like Samba, is to bypass the potentially buggy Plasma Firewall GUI and use the command-line interface for UFW directly.

1.  **Understand Samba Ports:** Samba typically uses the following ports:

      * **UDP 137 (NetBIOS Name Service)**
      * **UDP 138 (NetBIOS Datagram Service)**
      * **TCP 139 (NetBIOS Session Service)**
      * **TCP 445 (SMB over TCP/IP - preferred for modern Samba)**

2.  **Use UFW from the Terminal (Recommended):**

      * **Check UFW Status:** First, ensure UFW is active. Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:

        ```bash
        sudo ufw status verbose
        ```

        If it's inactive, enable it:

        ```bash
        sudo ufw enable
        ```

      * **Allow Samba by Application Profile:** UFW often has a predefined "Samba" application profile that opens the necessary ports. This is the easiest method.

        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow Samba
        ```

        If you want to restrict it to your local network (e.g., if your local network is `192.168.1.0/24`):

        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any app Samba
        ```

      * **Allow Samba by Port (if "Samba" profile doesn't work or for more control):**

        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow 137/udp
        sudo ufw allow 138/udp
        sudo ufw allow 139/tcp
        sudo ufw allow 445/tcp
        ```

        Again, you can restrict these to a specific network:

        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 137 proto udp
        sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 138 proto udp
        sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 139 proto tcp
        sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 445 proto tcp
        ```

      * **Reload UFW:** After making changes, reload UFW for them to take effect:

        ```bash
        sudo ufw reload
        ```

      * **Verify Rules:** Check the status again to confirm your new rules are active:

        ```bash
        sudo ufw status verbose
        ```

3.  **Alternative: GUFW (Graphical UFW):**
    If you prefer a GUI and the Plasma Firewall is giving you trouble, you can try installing `gufw`, which is a more direct graphical front-end for UFW.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gufw
    ```

    You can then launch GUFW from your application menu and use it to add the Samba rules.

4.  **Restart Samba Service:** After configuring your firewall, it's a good idea to restart the Samba service to ensure it picks up any network changes:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
    ```

**Regarding the "Please restart plasma firewall, the backend disconnected" error:**

  * While the above steps will allow Samba, the underlying bug with the Plasma Firewall GUI might persist.
  * Sometimes, simply logging out and logging back in, or restarting your system, can temporarily resolve the "backend disconnected" issue within Plasma Firewall. However, for consistent and reliable firewall management, using `ufw` directly or `gufw` is often preferred in MX Linux if you encounter this specific error.
  * Keep your MX Linux system updated, as bug fixes for Plasma Firewall might be released.

By using UFW directly from the terminal, you'll ensure that your Samba firewall rules are applied correctly, even if the Plasma Firewall GUI is misbehaving.
